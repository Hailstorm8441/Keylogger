# About
A simple app to test your WPM while typing built with the ReactJS framework and with a Firebase backend and auth system to save scores between sessions. You can access the project [here](https://wpm-typing-tester.web.app). This project is heavily inspired by the existing app monkeytype, which you can find [here](monkeytype.com).

# Features
- A typing system that accurately tells you your wpm
- Two modes of typing to choose from
- Different themes and fonts to choose from
- An account system to save scores between sessions

# Bug report
If you find a bug within the app, email me [here](mailto:Hailstorms_8440@proton.me) or create an issue within GitHub.

# Todo
- Add a leaderboard system.
- Clean up test code to be more efficient.
- Migrate to a different Firebase project to change the URL to match the new project name.
